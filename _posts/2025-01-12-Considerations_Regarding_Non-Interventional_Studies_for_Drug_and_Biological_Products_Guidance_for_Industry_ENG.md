Hyeon-woo Jeong gave a presentation. This guideline outlines the requirements for utilizing Real World Evidence (RWE) to demonstrate drug effectiveness and safety. A Non-Interventional Study refers to treatments conducted in routine practices, rather than clinical trials where treatments are administered according to a planned protocol.

As always, the most crucial aspects of RWE are data reliability and relevance. Once these are established, two key points need attention. First is preparing the protocol and statistical analysis plan before conducting the final analysis, and proceeding with the analysis according to these documents. Second is early collaboration with the FDA.

This guideline provides detailed descriptions of these two points. However, like the ICH M14 guideline and other related guidelines, they tend to repeat similar content. While the ICH M14 guideline focuses solely on safety, those interested in deeper study might find it worthwhile to examine the ICH M14 guideline.

The study group plans to examine medical devices and electronic health records next, and we expect to encounter some new content. So far, we've covered three main areas. First is conducting clinical trials in settings that simulate real clinical environments. In such cases, even clinical trial settings can be recognized as Real World Data (RWD). Second is accumulating RWD after drug marketing to generate RWE, then expanding the drug's marketing scope by demonstrating effectiveness and safety for indications beyond the initial approval. Third is a more extreme scenario where temporary drug approval is granted in urgent situations with no available treatment options. Even in such cases, RWD can be generated and used to create RWE. While we haven't yet examined medical devices, we expect the general framework to be similar, with some differences in specific details.
