When Statisticians Fall in Love üìä‚ù§Ô∏è

Had to share this amusing exchange between two statisticians who just started dating:

Statistician A: "We have a good fit to each other. I think this is because there is no prior."

Statistician B: "Yes, we have a good fit. However, that's nonsense about no prior. As a sincere Bayesian statistician, I must object! We have to consider non-informative prior. Even though we have no prior experience, it's still a prior distribution. Everything is Bayesian!"

Who knew statistical modeling could be so romantic?
