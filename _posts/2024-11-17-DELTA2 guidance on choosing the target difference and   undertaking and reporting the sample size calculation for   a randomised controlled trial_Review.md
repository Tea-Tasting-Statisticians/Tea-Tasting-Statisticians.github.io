# Introduction
- **RCT(randomised controlled trials)**
    - Properly conducted, randomised controlled trials are considered to be the best method for
        - assessing  the comparative clinical efficacy and
        - effectiveness of healthcare interventions,
        - providing a key source of data for estimating cost effectiveness
- **priori sample size calculation**
    - Central to the design of a randomised controlled trial
    - ensures that the study has a high probability of achieving its prespecified objective
- **The difference** between groups
    - used to calculate a sample size for the trial (known as the target difference)   is
    - the magnitude of difference in the outcome of interest that
        - the randomised controlled trial is designed to reliably detect
- **The DELTA2 project**,
    - commissioned by the United Kingdom’s Medical Research Council/National Institute for Health Research Methodology Research Programme and
    - aimed to produce updated guidance
        - for researchers and funders
        - on specifying and reporting the target difference (the effect   size)
            - in the sample size calculation of a randomised controlled trial.
- we summarise
    - the process of developing the new guidance, as well as
    - the relevant considerations, key messages, and 
    - recommendations for researchers determining and reporting
        - sample size calculations for randomised controlled trials

## Box 1: DELTA2 recommendations for researchers undertaking a sample size calculation and choosing the target difference  
- Begin by searching for **relevant literature** to inform the specification of the target difference.
    - Relevant literature can: 
        - relate to a **candidate primary outcome** or the comparison of interest, and; 
        - inform what is an **important or realistic difference**
            - for that outcome, comparison, and population. 
- Candidate **primary outcomes** should be considered in turn, and
    - the **corresponding sample size** explored.
    - Where multiple candidate outcomes are considered,
        - the choice of the primary outcome and target difference should be based on
            - consideration of the views of relevant stakeholder groups (eg, patients), as well as
            - the practicality of undertaking such a study with the required sample size.
        - The choice should not be based solely on
            - which outcome yields the minimum sample size.
            - Ideally, the final sample size will be sufficient for all key outcomes,  
                - although this is not always practical. 
- The **importance of observing a particular magnitude** of a difference in an outcome,
    - with the exception of mortality and other serious adverse events,
    - cannot be presumed to be self evident.
    - Therefore, the target difference for all other outcomes needs
        - additional justification to infer importance to a stakeholder group. 
- The target difference for a **definitive trial (eg, phase III)** should be one
    - considered to be important to at least one key stakeholder group. 
- The target difference does **not necessarily have to be the minimum value**
    - that would be considered important
    - if a larger difference is considered a realistic possibility or would be necessary to alter practice. 
- Where **additional research** is needed to inform what would be an important difference,
    - **the anchor and opinion seeking methods** are to be favoured.
    - The distribution method should not be used.
        - Reference for the anchor and the distribution method
            - [https://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12955-018-1055-z](https://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12955-018-1055-z)
    - Specifying the target difference based solely on a
        - standardised effect size approach should be considered a last resort,
- Where additional research is needed to inform what would be a realistic difference,
    - the **opinion seeking and the review of the evidence base methods** are recommended.
    - Pilot trials are typically too small to inform what would be a realistic difference and
        - primarily address other aspects of trial design and conduct. 
- Use **existing studies** to inform the value of key nuisance parameters
    - that are part of the sample size calculation.
    - For example, a pilot trial can be used
        - to inform the choice of the standard deviation value for a continuous outcome and
        - the control group proportion for a binary outcome,
        - along with other relevant inputs such as the amount of missing outcome data. 
- **Sensitivity analyses**, used in the sample size calculation, should be carried out. 
    - which consider **the effect of uncertainty around key inputs**
        - (eg, the target difference and the control group proportion for a binary outcome)
- **Specification of the sample size calculation**, including the target difference,
    - should be reported according to the guidance for reporting items (see table 1)
        - when preparing key trial documents (grant applications, protocols, and result manuscripts).

## Development of the DELTA 2 guidance
- The DELTA2 guidance is the culmination of a five stage process
    - to meet the stated project objectives (fig  1),  which included
        - two literature reviews of existing funder guidance and
        - recent methodological literature,  
        - a Delphi process to engage with a wider group of stakeholders,
        - a two day workshop, and
        - finalisation of the core guidance.
            ![](/img/Pasted image 20240823231824.png)
- The core guidance was provisionally
    - finalised in October 2017 and 
    - reviewed by the funders’ representatives for comment  
    - (Methodology Research Programme advisory group).  
    - The guidance was further revised and finalised in February 2018.
    - The full guidance document incorporating case studies and relevant appendices is available here.

    - Further details on the findings of the Delphi study and the wider engagement with   stakeholders are reported elsewhere.
    - The guidance and key messages are summarised in the remainder of this paper.

## The target difference and sample size calculations in   randomised controlled trials 
- The **role of the sample size calculation** is
    - to determine how many patients are required
    - for the planned analysis of the primary outcome to be informative
    - It is typically achieved by
        - specifying a target difference for the key (primary) outcome
        - that can be reliably detected and the required sample size calculated
- The precise research question that the trial is primarily set up to answer
    - will determine what needs to be estimated in the planned primary analysis,
    - which is known formally as the **“estimand”**
        - The target difference should be a difference that is appropriate for that estimand.
- The target difference should be viewed as important by
    - at least one (and preferably more) key stakeholder groups— 
        - that is, patients, health professionals, regulatory  agencies, and healthcare funders.
    - In practice, the target difference is not always formally considered and  
        - in many cases appears, at least from trial reports, to be determined on convenience, the research budget, or some other informal basis.
- The target difference can be expressed as an
    - **absolute** difference
        - (eg, mean   difference or difference in proportions) or
    - **relative**   difference
        - (eg, hazard or risk ratio)
    - is also often referred to, rather imprecisely, as the **trial “effect size**
- Statistical calculation of the sample size is far from an exact science
    - Firstly, investigators typically **make assumptions**
        - that are a simplification of the anticipated analysis.
        - For example, the impact of adjusting for baseline factors is difficult to quantify upfront,
            - and even though the analysis is intended to be an adjusted one
                - (such as when randomisation has been stratified or minimised),
            - the sample size calculation is often conducted on the basis of an unadjusted analysis.
    - Secondly, the calculated sample size can be sensitive to the assumptions made in the calculations
        - a small change in one of the assumptions can lead  
            - to substantial change in the calculated sample size. 
        -  Often a simple formula can be used to calculate the required sample size.
- it is necessary for researchers to balance
    - the risk of incorrectly concluding that there is a difference (**Type I error**)
        - when no actual difference between the treatments exists,
    - with the risk of failing to identify a meaningful treatment difference when the treatments do differ(**Type II error**)
    - Under the conventional approach, referred to as **the statistical hypothesis testing framework** 
        - the probabilities of these two errors are controlled by setting
            - the significance level (type I error) and  
            - statistical power (1 minus type II error) at appropriate levels
            - (typical values are two sided 5% significance and 80% or 90% power, respectively).
        - Once these two inputs have been set, the sample size can be determined given
            - the magnitude of the between group difference in the outcome it is desired to detect  
                - (the target difference).
        - The calculation (reflecting the intended analysis) is conventionally done
            - on the basis of **testing for a difference of any magnitude**
- A key question of interest is what magnitude of difference can be ruled out.
    - The expected (predicted) width of the confidence interval can be determined
        - for a given target difference and sample size calculation,  
    - The required sample size is very sensitive to the target difference.
        - Under the conventional approach,  
            - halving the target difference quadruples the sample size for a two arm, 1:1, parallel group superiority trial  with a continuous outcome.
                ![](/img/Pasted image 20240823231849.png)
        - Appropriate sample size formulas vary depending on
            - the proposed trial design and
            - statistical analysis
- In more complex scenarios, simulations can be used
    - It is prudent to undertake sensitivity calculations to assess
        - the potential effect of misspecification of key assumptions such as
            - the control response rate for a binary outcome or
            - the anticipated variance of a   continuous outcome 

## Specifying the target difference for a randomised controlled trial
- the specification of the target difference for a randomised controlled trial,  
    - a series of recommendations is provided in box 1 and table 1.
    - Seven broad types of methods can be used
        - to  justify the choice of a particular value as the target difference, which are summarised in box 2
- Box 2: Methods that can help inform the choice of the target difference
    - Methods that inform what is an **important difference**
        - **Anchor**
            - using either a patients' or health professional’s judgment to define what an important difference is
            - by comparing a patients' health before and after treatment and then
                - linking this change to participants who showed improvement or deterioration using a more familiar outcome
        - **Distribution**
            - determine a value based on distributional variation
            - use a value that is larger than the inherent imprecision in the measurement and therefore
            - likely to represent a **minimal level** needed for a noticeable difference
        - **Health economic**
            - use the principles of economic evaluation
                - compare cost with
                    - health outcomes and
                    - define a threshold value for the cost of a unit of healt effect that a decision maker is willing to pay
            - to estimate the overall incremental net benefit of one treatment versus the comparator
        - **Standardised effect size**
            - the magnitude of the effect on a standardised scale defines the value of the difference
            - For continuous outcome, the standardised difference can be used
                - e.g., Cohen’s d effect size
                    - the mean difference/the S.D
            - For binary or survival(time-to-event) outcome, odds, risk or hazard ratio can be used
                - no widely recognised cutoff points exist
    - Methods that inform what is a **realistic difference**
        - **Pilot Study**
            - to guide expectations and determine an appropriate target difference for the trial
            - Phase 2 study could be used to inform Phase 3 study
    - Methods that inform what is **an important or a realistic** difference
        - **Opinion seeking**
            - the target difference can be based on opinions elicited from health professionals, patients, or others
            - Possible approaches
                - forming a panel of experts
                - surveying the membership of a professional or patient body
                - intervewing individuals
        - **Review of evidence base**
            - the target difference can be derived from current evidence on the research question
            - Ideally, from a systematic review or meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials
            - In the absence of randomised evidence, evidence from observational studies could be used in a similar manner
- Target difference should always be both important and realistic,
    - which would seem particularly apt
        - when designing a definitive (phase 3) superiority randomised controlled trial.
    - In a   sample size calculation for a randomised controlled trial,
        - the target difference between the treatment groups strictly relates to
            - a group level difference for the anticipated study population.

## Reporting the sample size calculation 
- The approach taken to determine the sample size and the assumptions made should be clearly specified.
    - all the inputs and formula or simulation results,
        - so that it is clear what the sample size was based on.
        - critical for reporting transparency,
        - allows the sample size calculation to be replicated, and
        - clarifies the primary   (statistical) aim of the study.
- approach with a standard trial design (1:1 allocation,   two arm, parallel group, superiority design) and   unadjusted statistical analysis,
    - the core items are
        - the primary outcome, the target difference appropriately specified according to
            - the outcome type,
            - the associated nuisance parameter
                - (that is, a parameter that, together with the target difference, uniquely specifies the difference on the original outcome scale
                - eg, the event rate in the control group for a binary primary outcome), and
            - the statistical significance and power
- More complicated designs can have additional inputs
    - such as the intracluster correlation for a cluster randomised design
- When the sample size calculation deviates from the conventional approach,
    - whether by research question or statistical framework,
    - the core reporting set can be modified to provide
        - sufficient detail to ensure that the sample size calculation is reproducible and
        - the rationale for choosing the target difference is transparent.
- If the sample size is determined on the basis of a series of simulations,  
    - this method should be described in sufficient detail
        - to provide an equivalent level of transparency and assessment

# Discussion
- Researchers are faced with a number of difficult decisions when designing a randomised controlled trial, the most important decisions are
    - The choice of  **trial design**,
    - **primary outcome**, and
    - **sample size**
- The  sample size is largely driven by
    - the choice of the **target difference**
- The **DELTA2 guidance** provides help on
    - specifying a target difference and
    - undertaking and reporting the sample size calculation for a randomised controlled   trial.
    - The guidance was developed in response to a growing recognition from funders, researchers, and   other key stakeholders (such as patients and the   respective clinical communities) of a
        - real need for practical and accessible advice to inform a difficult decision.
- The key message for researchers is the need
    - to be more explicit about **the rationale** and
    - **justification** of the target difference
        - when undertaking and reporting a sample size calculation.
    - Increasing focus is being placed on the target difference
        - in the clinical interpretation of the trial result,
        - whether statistically significant or not.
