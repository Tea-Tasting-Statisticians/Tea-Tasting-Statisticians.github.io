# Introduction
- The lackluster performance of  many machine learning (ML) systems in healthcare
    - has been well   documented.
    - In healthcare, AI algorithms can even perpetuate human prejudices such as
        - sexism and racism when trained on biased datasets

##    
Box 1 | Recommendations to avoid overuse and misuse of AI in clinical research 
- 1. Whenever appropriate, (predefined)  **sensitivity analyses**
    - using **traditional statistical models** should be presented alongside ML models. 
- 2. **Protocols** should be published and peer reviewed whenever possible, and 
    - the choice of model should be stated and substantiated. 
- 3. All model **performance parameters** should be disclosed and, ideally,
    - the dataset and analysis script should be made public. 
- 4. Publications using ML algorithms should be accompanied by **disclaimers** 
    - about their **decision-making process**, and
    - their conclusions should be carefully formulated.  
- 5. Researchers should commit to developing **interpretable and transparent** ML algorithms
    - that can be subjected to checks and balances. 
- 6. Datasets should be **inspected** for **sources of bias** and
    - necessary steps taken to address biases. 
- 7. The **type of ML technique** used should be chosen taking into account
    - the type, size and dimensionality of the available dataset. 
- 8. ML techniques should be **avoided** when dealing with
    - **very small**, but  readily available, **convenience clinical datasets**. 
- 9. Clinician–researchers should aim to procure and utilize
    - **large, harmonized multicenter or international datasets** with high-resolution data, if feasible. 
- 10. A **guideline on the choice of statistical approach**,
    - whether ML or traditional statistical techniques, would
    - aid clinical researchers and highlight proper choices

## Failure to replicate 
- At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,
    - the development of ML algorithms to estimate the probability of infection was hot.
        - These algorithms based their predictions on various data elements 
            - captured in electronic health records, such as chest radiographs
    - Despite their promising initial validation results,
        - the success of numerous artificial neural networks trained on chest X-rays  
            - were largely not replicated when applied to different hospital settings,
            - in part because the models failed to learn or understand the true underlying pathology of COVID-19
    - These ML algorithms were
        - not explainable and,
        - were inferior to traditional diagnostic techniques such as RT-PCR,  
        - obviating their usefulness.
    - More than 200 prediction models were developed for COVID-19,
        - some using ML, and
        - virtually all suffer from poor reporting and high risk of bias

##  Avoiding overuse 
- The term ‘overuse’ refers to
    - the unnecessary adoption of AI or advanced ML techniques  
    - where alternative, reliable or superior methodologies already exist.
    - In such cases, the use of AI and ML techniques is
        - not necessarily inappropriate or unsound,  
        - but the justification for such research is  unclear or artificial:
        - for example, a novel technique may be proposed that delivers no meaningful new answers. 
- A high AUC is not necessarily a mark of quality,
- as the ML model might be over-fit  (Fig. 1).
- Figure 1 **Model fitting**
    ![](../img/Figure1.png)
- When a traditional regression technique is applied and compared against ML algorithms,
    - the more sophisticated ML models often offer
    - only marginal accuracy gains,
    - presenting a questionable  trade-off between model complexity and accuracy
- Even very high AUCs are no guarantees of robustness,
    - as an AUC of 0.99 with an overall event rate of <1% is possible, and
    - would lead to all negative cases being predicted correctly,
    - while the few positive events were not
- many simple medical prediction problems are inherently linear,
    - with features that are chosen because they are known to be strong predictors,
    - usually on  the basis of prior research or mechanistic considerations.
        - In these cases, it is unlikely that
        - ML methods will provide a substantial improvement in discrimination
- modest improvements in medical prediction accuracy are
    - unlikely to yield a difference in clinical action
- ML techniques should be evaluated against traditional statistical methodologies 
    - before they are deployed.
    - If the objective of a study is to develop a predictive model, 
        - ML algorithms should be compared to a predefined set of traditional regression techniques
            - for Brier score
                - (an evaluation metric similar to the mean squared error,  used to check the goodness of a predicted   probability score)
                - [https://data.library.virginia.edu/a-brief-on-brier-scores/](https://data.library.virginia.edu/a-brief-on-brier-scores/)
            - discrimination (or AUC) and calibration.
        - The model should then be externally validated

## Rationalize usage 
- Researchers should start any ML project with
    - clear project goals and
    - an analysis of  the advantages that AI, ML or conventional statistical techniques
        - deliver in the specific clinical use case
    - If the objective of a study is to develop  a new prognostic nomogram or predictive model,
        - there is little evidence that ML will fare better than traditional statistical models
            - even when dealing with large and highly dimensional datasets
    - If the purpose of a study is to infer a causal treatment effect of a given exposure,
        - many  well-established traditional statistical techniques, such as
            - structural equation modelling, propensity-score methodology,  instrumental variables analysis a regression discontinuity analysis,
            - yield  readily interpretable and rigorous estimates of the treatment effect

## Avoiding misuse 
- the term ‘misuse’ connotes more egregious usages of ML,  
    - ranging from problematic methodology that engenders spurious inferences or predictions,
    - to applications of ML that endeavor to replace the role of physicians  
        - in situations which should still require a human input
- Indiscriminately accepting an AI algorithm
    - purely based on its performance, 
    - without scrutinizing its internal workings, 
        - represents a misuse of ML19, although
        - it is questionable to what extent every clinician decision is robustly explainable
- Many groups have called for explainable ML or the incorporation of counterfactual reasoning
    - in order to disentangle correlation from causation
    - The notion of a ‘black box’  that underpins clinical decision-making 
        - is an antithesis to the modern practice of medicine and
        - is increasingly inaccurate,  
            - given the growing armamentarium of techniques such as
                - saliency maps and  generative adversarial networks
                - that can  be used to probe the reasoning made by neural networks
- Researchers should commit to developing ML models that are
    - interpretable, with their reasoning standing up to scrutiny by  human experts, and
    - to sharing de-identified data and scripts
        - that would allow external replication and validation

## Data constraints 
- Usage of ML in spite of data constraints, such as biased data and small datasets,
    - is another misuse of AI.
- Deep learning techniques are known to require large  amounts of data,
    - but many publications in the medical literature
        - feature techniques with much smaller sample and feature-set sizes than
        - are typically available in other technological industries.
            - Meta’s Facebook trained its facial recognition software using photos from more than 1 billion users;
            - autonomous automobile developers use billions of miles of road traffic video recordings from   hundreds of thousands of individual drivers in order to develop software to recognize road objects; and
            - DeepBlue and AlphaGo learn from millions or billions of played games of chess and Go
    - In   contrast, clinical research studies involving AI generally
        - use thousands or hundreds of radiological and pathological images,  and
        - surgeon–scientists developing software for surgical phase recognition
            - often work with no more than several dozen surgical videos
    - These observations underscore
        - the relative poverty of big data in healthcare and
        - the importance of working toward achieving sample sizes  ike those that have been attained in other   industries, as well as
        - the importance of a concerted, international big-data sharing effort for health data. 

## Human–machine collaboration 
- The respective functions of humans and algorithms in delivering healthcare are not the same
    - ML algorithms can complement, but not replace,
        - physicians in most aspects of clinical medicine,
            - from history-taking and physical examination
            - to diagnosis, therapeutic decisions and performing procedures.  
    - Clinician–investigators must therefore 
        - forge a cohesive framework whereby big data propels
            - a new generation of human– machine collaboration
- ML applications are likely to exist as
    - discrete decision-support modules to support specific aspects of patient care,
    - rather than competing against their human counterparts
- Human patients are likely to want 
    - human doctors to continue making medical decisions,
    - no matter how well an algorithm  can predict outcomes.
- ML should, therefore, be
    - studied and implemented as
        - an integral part of a complete system of care.
- The clinical integration of ML and big data is poised to improve medicine.
    - ML  researchers should recognize the limits of their algorithms and models
        - in order to prevent their overuse and misuse,
            - which  would otherwise sow distrust and cause patient harm
